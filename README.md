SSHer: Secure Shell Access Manager
Overview
SSHer is a web application designed to simplify the management of SSH server credentials and facilitate secure shell access to multiple servers through a user-friendly interface. With SSHer, users can securely store their SSH server credentials and seamlessly connect to their servers from any browser.

Features
User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account and securely log in to SSHer using their username and password.

SSH Credential Management: Once logged in, users can add, edit, and delete multiple SSH server credentials, including host, port, username, and password.

Secure Connection Handling: SSHer ensures the secure handling of sensitive information by encrypting user passwords and securely transmitting data over the network.

SSH Terminal Interface: Users can interact with their SSH servers directly from the browser using a terminal-like interface, allowing them to execute commands and manage server resources.

How It Works
User Registration: Users create an account by providing a unique username, email, and password. Upon successful registration, they can log in to the application.

SSH Credential Management: After logging in, users can navigate to the SSH Credential Management page, where they can add, edit, and delete SSH server credentials. Each credential includes details such as host, port, username, and password.

SSH Terminal Access: When users want to connect to an SSH server, they can select a saved credential from the list and click on it to initiate an SSH connection. This opens a new page with a terminal interface where users can execute commands and interact with the server.

Secure Communication: SSHer ensures the security of user data by encrypting passwords and transmitting data over HTTPS. User sessions are managed securely to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Getting Started
